    <p>I do quite a bit of streaming! My goal with these is to provide a high quality accompaniment to the game itself, and also to show it off. I try to take things slowly and appreciate the myriad details left in the environment, really soaking up everything in a given area that I can find before moving on. I typically play narrative adventure games and role playing games, but I appreciate all games, so there are dashes of something else here and there too. If that sounds like the kind of stream for you, hop aboard!</p>
